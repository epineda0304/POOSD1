This is just a quick run down of how to use MySQL and some things that I encountered in case you guys
have to mess with the code or have to run certain commands.

Database name: contacts
1st Table name: users
2nd Table name: people

Every string has a max input of size 15 except for the phone number which is 10

First off, if you're running the SQL code in MySQL workbench then in order to run the code you actually
have to go line by line. The IDE will run the line of code that your cursor is indexed at (where you're gonna type next).

However, anyone referencing this most likely will only need to know how to insert, delete or modify data
in the database through the command line or what not. In that case (Note I did my best to keep all keywords capital):

================Inserting data example======================

INSERT INTO users (Username, Pwd) VALUES ("em764", "a234");

Break down :

INSERT INTO  users   (Username, Pwd) VALUES ("em764", "a234");
  ^     ^     ^        ^       ^       ^        ^        ^
 Keywords  table name  which vars    Keyword      Values

 ================Deleting data example======================

 Deleting a single entry by first name (this could be done by phone number or last name as well)

 DELETE FROM people WHERE First_name = 'Manny';

 Break down:

 DELETE FROM people WHERE First_name = 'Manny';
              ^               ^           ^
              table        which var   value

 ================Editing data example======================

 Editing a phone number but it can also be names as well

 UPDATE people SET Phone_num = '4072624049' WHERE First_name = 'Luis';

 Break down:

 UPDATE people SET Phone_num = '4072624049' WHERE First_name = 'Luis';
          ^          ^                                ^           ^
          table     what to change                 where to change

 ================Retrieving data example======================


 This displays all the contacts specifically for the user whose id is 1 in
 order by first name. Of course if you change the id to 2 itll pull up all
 contacts for that user with id 2

 SELECT * FROM people WHERE User_ID = 1 ORDER BY First_name;

 Break down:

 SELECT * FROM       people WHERE User_ID = 1 ORDER BY First_name;
        ^              ^            ^               ^
select everything    table          who          organized by first name

doing the following will display only first and last name and phone number

 SELECT First_name,
        Last_name,
        Phone_num
        FROM people WHERE User_ID = 1 ORDER BY First_name;

or if you want to show everything in our tables you can do

SELECT * FROM users;

or

SELECT * FROM people;
